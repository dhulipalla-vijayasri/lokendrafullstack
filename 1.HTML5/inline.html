    <h3 ALIGN="center">MOBILE COMPANIES IN WORLD</h3><p id="index">Whitehawk Camp is the remains of a causewayed enclosure, on Whitehawk Hill near Brighton, England. Causewayed enclosures are a form of early Neolithic earthwork, characterized by the enclosure of an area with ditches that are interrupted by gaps, or causeways. Their purpose is not known. The site consists of four roughly concentric circular ditches; at least two ditches touch the outermost circuit from the outside, one of which is thought to date to about two thousand years after the earliest dated activity at the site. Whitehawk was first excavated in 1929 and again in the winter of 1932–1933. In 1935 the area to be crossed by a new road was excavated. In 1991, during the construction of a housing development, a ditch was discovered and excavated. In 2011, an analysis of radiocarbon dates concluded that the Neolithic part of the site was probably constructed between 3650 and 3500 BC, and probably went out of use some time between 3500 and 3400 BC.</p>
<h4><b></b>OPPO</b></h4>

<h4><b></b>REAL ME</b></h4>
<p id="realme" align="justify">Realme first appeared in China in 2010 with the name "OPPO Real".[1] It was a sub-brand of Oppo (which is itself a subsidiary of BBK Electronics)[2] until its formation as a spinoff on May 4, 2018.[3][4][5] Oppo did not specify whether it had transferred its participation in Realme to BBK.

    In May 2018, they released their first phone, Realme 1.
    
    On July 30, 2018, former Oppo Vice President and Head of Oppo's Overseas Department, Sky Li, announced his official resignation from Oppo and his intention to establish Realme as an independent brand on Weibo. With the company slogan "Dare to Leap", he declared that in the future, the Realme brand would focus on providing mobile phones with solid performance and stylish design, offering young people a joyful life with affordable "technology" and "beauty".[6]
    
    On 15 November 2018, Realme adopted a new logo.
    
    On November 22, 2018, Realme became the No. 1 emerging brand in the Indian market.[7] The sales of Realme devices in India have since surpassed the sales of its parent company Oppo. Realme has been the fourth largest smartphone brand in India since 2019, behind Xiaomi, Samsung, and Vivo. Realme holds many records in India including India's first 64MP smartphone, India's fastest-charging smartphone, and India's first 5G smartphone.[citation needed]
    
    On May 15, 2019, Realme held its first conference in Beijing to officially enter the Chinese domestic market, launching the Realme X, Realme X Lite and Realme X Master Edition.[8][9]

    By August 2019, Realme had surpassed 10 million users worldwide.[10]
    
    In August 2019, Realme showed a prototype device with a quadruple 64MP camera in China and India</p>
<h4><b>ONEPLUS</b></h4>
<p id="oneplus" align="justify">OnePlus was founded on 16 December 2013 by former Oppo vice-president Pete Lau and Carl Pei.[7] According to Chinese public records, OnePlus' only institutional shareholder is Oppo Electronics.[4] Lau denied that OnePlus was a wholly owned subsidiary of Oppo and stated that Oppo Electronics and not Oppo Mobile (the phone manufacturer) is a major investor of OnePlus and that they are "in talks with other investors",[8] although OnePlus has confirmed it uses Oppo's manufacturing line and shares part of the supply chain resources with Oppo.[9] The company's main goal was to design a smartphone that would balance high-end quality with a lower price than other phones in its class, believing that users would "Never Settle" for the lower-quality devices produced by other companies. Lau explained that "we will never be different just for the sake of being different. Everything done has to improve the actual user experience in day-to-day use."[10][11] He also showed aspirations of being the "Muji of the tech industry", emphasizing its focus on high-quality products with simplistic, user-friendly designs.[10] Continuing Lau's association with the platform from the Oppo N1,[11] OnePlus entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Cyanogen Inc. to base its products' Android distribution upon a variant of the popular custom ROM CyanogenMod and use its trademarks outside of China.[12][13]

    The company unveiled its first device, the OnePlus One, on 23 April 2014 which was intended to capture market from the Google Nexus series.[10] In December 2014, alongside the release of the OnePlus One in India exclusively through Amazon, OnePlus also announced plans to establish a presence in the country, with plans to open 25 official walk-in service centers across India.[14]
    
    In April 2014, OnePlus hired Han Han to help market its products in mainland China.[15]
    
    On 9 March 2014, the company expanded its operations to the European Union.[16]
    
    On 16 December 2014, The Supreme Court of India and Delhi High Court banned the import and sale of OnePlus One phones following a lawsuit by Micromax alleging it has exclusivity for shipping phones with Cyanogen OS software in India.[17] On 21 December 2014, the ban was lifted. The device continues to be shipped with Cyanogen OS; however, a customized version of Android specially designed by OnePlus and named OxygenOS has been released, allowing later OnePlus devices to be sold in India.[18][19]
    
    OnePlus made its products available in Southeast Asia for the first time, partnering with Lazada Indonesia[20] on 23 January 2015 and was expected to expand during that year throughout the region. In June 2016, OnePlus decided to pull out of the Indonesian market due to local regulations for imported 4G smartphones restricting sales of the OnePlus 2.[21]
    
    At the launch event of the OnePlus 6 on 17 May 2018, OnePlus announced it would be opening five new OnePlus Experience stores in India, as well as 10 new service centers</p>
<h4><b>NOKIA</b></h4>
<p id="nokia" align="justify">Nokia's history dates from 1865, when Finnish-Swede mining engineer Fredrik Idestam established a pulp mill near the town of Tampere, Finland (then in the Russian Empire). A second pulp mill was opened in 1868 near the neighboring town of Nokia, offering better hydropower resources. In 1871, Idestam, together with a friend Leo Mechelin, formed a shared company from it and called it Nokia Ab (in Swedish, Nokia Company being the English equivalent), after the site of the second pulp mill.

    Idestam retired in 1896, making Mechelin the company's chairman; he expanded into electricity generation by 1902, which Idestam had opposed. In 1904 Suomen Gummitehdas (Finnish Rubber Works), a rubber business founded by Eduard Polón, established a factory near the town of Nokia and used its name.
    
    In 1922, in a now independent Finland, Nokia Ab entered into a partnership with Finnish Rubber Works and Kaapelitehdas (the Cable Factory), all now jointly under the leadership of Polón. The rubber company grew rapidly when it moved to the Nokia region in the 1930s to take advantage of the electrical power supply, and the cable company soon did too.
    
    Nokia at the time also made respirators for both civilian and military use, from the 1930s well into the early 1990s
    n 1967, the three companies – Nokia, Kaapelitehdas, and Finnish Rubber Works – merged and created a new Nokia Corporation, restructured into four major businesses: forestry, cable, rubber, and electronics. In the early 1970s, it entered the networking and radio industry. Nokia started making military equipment for Finland's defence forces (Puolustusvoimat), such as the Sanomalaite M/90 communicator in 1983, and the M61 gas mask first developed in the 1960s. Nokia was now also making professional mobile radios, telephone switches, capacitors and chemicals.

    After Finland's trade agreement with the Soviet Union in the 1960s, Nokia expanded into the Soviet market. It soon widened trade, ranging from automatic telephone exchanges to robotics among others; by the late 1970s, the Soviet Union became a major market for Nokia, helping to yield high profits. Nokia also co-operated on scientific technology with the Soviet Union. The U.S. government became increasingly suspicious of that co-operation after the end of the Cold War détente in the early 1980s. Nokia imported many US-made components and used them in products for the Soviets, and according to U.S. Deputy Minister of Defence, Richard Perle, Nokia had a secret co-operation with The Pentagon that allowed the U.S. to keep track of technology developments in the Soviet Union through trading with Nokia.[30] This was a demonstration of Finland trading with both sides, as it was neutral during the Cold War.
    
    In 1977, Kari Kairamo became CEO and transformed the company's businesses. By this time</p>
    <h4><b>SAMSUNG</b></h4>
    <p  id="samsung" align="justify">The Samsung Group[3] (Korean: 삼성, stylized as SΛMSUNG) is a South Korean multinational conglomerate headquartered in Samsung Town, Seoul.[1] It comprises numerous affiliated businesses,[1] most of them united under the Samsung brand, and is the largest South Korean chaebol (business conglomerate).

        Samsung was founded by Lee Byung-chul in 1938 as a trading company. Over the next three decades, the group diversified into areas including food processing, textiles, insurance, securities, and retail. Samsung entered the electronics industry in the late 1960s and the construction and shipbuilding industries in the mid-1970s; these areas would drive its subsequent growth. Following Lee's death in 1987, Samsung was separated into five business groups – Samsung Group, Shinsegae Group, CJ Group and Hansol Group, and Joongang Group. Since 1990, Samsung has increasingly globalised its activities and electronics; in particular, its mobile phones and semiconductors have become its most important source of income. As of 2020, Samsung has the 8th highest global brand value.[4]
        
        Notable Samsung industrial affiliates include Samsung Electronics (the world's largest information technology company, consumer electronics maker and chipmaker measured by 2017 revenues),[5][6] Samsung Heavy Industries (the world's 2nd largest shipbuilder measured by 2010 revenues),[7] and Samsung Engineering and Samsung C&T Corporation (respectively the world's 13th and 36th largest construction companies).[8] Other notable subsidiaries include Samsung Life Insurance (the world's 14th largest life insurance company),[9] Samsung Everland (operator of Everland Resort, the oldest theme park in South Korea)[10] and Cheil Worldwide (the world's 15th largest advertising agency, as measured by 2012 revenues).[11][12]
        
        Samsung has a powerful influence on South Korea's economic development, politics, media and culture and has been a major driving force behind the "Miracle on the Han River".[13][14] Its affiliate companies produce around a fifth of South Korea's total exports.[15] Samsung's revenue was equal to 17% of South Korea's $1,082 billion GDP

        This industry fact sheet is to assist industry professionals, investors, and people in general that are interested in gaining insights into the global computer equipment industry including:</p>
    <h4><b>HCL</b></h4>
    <p id="hcl" align="justify">In 1976, a group of six engineers, all former employees of Delhi Cloth & General Mills, led by Shiv Nadar, started a company that would make personal computers. Initially floated as Microcomp Limited, Nadar and his team (which also included Arjun Malhotra, Ajai Chowdhry, D.S. Puri, Yogesh Vaidya and Subhash Arora) started selling teledigital calculators to gather capital for their main product. On 11 August 1976, the company was renamed Hindustan Computers Limited (HCL).[23]

        On 12 November 1991, a company called HCL Overseas Limited was incorporated as a provider of technology development services. It received the certificate of commencement of business on 10 February 1992 after which it began its operations. Two years later, in July 1994, the company name was changed to HCL Consulting Limited and eventually to HCL Technologies Limited in October 1999.
        
        HCL Technologies is one of the four companies under HCL Corporation, the second company being HCL Infosystems. In February 2014 HCL launched HCL Healthcare.[24] HCL TalentCare is the fourth and latest venture of HCL Corporation.[25]
        
        HCL Technologies began as the R&D Division of HCL Enterprise,[26] a company which was a contributor to the development and growth of the IT and computer industry in India. HCL Enterprise developed an indigenous microcomputer in 1978,[27] and a networking OS and client-server architecture in 1983.[28] On 12 November 1991, HCL Technologies was spun off as a separate unit to provide software services.
        
        HCL Technologies was originally incorporated as HCL Overseas Limited.[29] The name was changed to HCL Consulting Limited on 14 July 1994.[30] On 6 October 1999, the company was renamed 'HCL Technologies Limited' for "a better reflection of its activities."[29] Between 1991 and 1999, the company expanded its software development capacities to US, European and APAC markets.[</p>
    <h4><b>HP</b></h4>
    <p id="hp" align="justify">The company got its first big contract in 1938, providing its test and measurement instruments for production of Walt Disney's hugely successful animated film Fantasia. This success led Hewlett and Packard to formally establish their Hewlett-Packard Company on January 1, 1939. The company grew into a multinational corporation widely respected for its products, and its management style and culture known as the HP Way, which was adopted by other businesses worldwide. HP was the world's leading PC manufacturer from 2007 until the second quarter of 2013, when Lenovo moved ahead of HP.[1][2][3] HP specialized in developing and manufacturing computing, data storage, and networking hardware, designing software and delivering services. Major product lines included personal computing devices, enterprise and industry standard servers, related storage devices, networking products, software and a diverse range of printers and other imaging products. HP directly marketed its products to households, small- to medium-sized businesses and enterprises as well as via online distribution, consumer-electronics and office-supply retailers, software partners and major technology vendors. HP also offered services and a consulting business for its products and partner products.
        In 1999, Hewlett-Packard Company spun off its electronic and bio-analytical test and measurement instruments business as Agilent Technologies; HP retained focus on its later products, including computers and printers. It merged with Compaq in 2002, and acquired EDS in 2008, leading to combined revenues of $118.4 billion that year and a Fortune 500 ranking of 9 in 2009. In November 2009, HP announced its acquisition of 3Com,[4] with the deal closing on April 12, 2010.[5] On April 28, 2010, HP announced its buyout of Palm, Inc. for $1.2 billion.[6] On September 2, 2010, HP won its bidding war for 3PAR with a $33 a share offer ($2.07 billion), which Dell declined to match.[7]

On November 1, 2015, the company spun off its enterprise products and services business Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Hewlett-Packard retained the personal computer and printer businesses and was renamed HP Inc

    <h3><b>DELL</b></h3>
    <p id="dell" align="justify">Dell is an American multinational computer technology company that develops, sells, repairs, and supports computers and related products and services, and is owned by its parent company of Dell Technologies. Founded in 1984 by Michael Dell, the company is one of the largest technology corporations in the world, employing more than 165,000 people in the U.S. and around the world.[4]

        Dell sells personal computers (PCs), servers, data storage devices, network switches, software, computer peripherals, HDTVs, cameras, printers, and electronics built by other manufacturers. The company is well known for its innovations in supply chain management and electronic commerce, particularly its direct-sales model and its "build-to-order" or "configure to order" approach to manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications.[5][6] Dell was a pure hardware vendor for much of its existence, but with the acquisition in 2009 of Perot Systems, Dell entered the market for IT services. The company has since made additional acquisitions in storage and networking systems, with the aim of expanding their portfolio from offering computers only to delivering complete solutions[buzzword] for enterprise customers.[7][8]
        
        Dell was listed at number 51 in the Fortune 500 list, until 2014.[9] It is the world's 3rd largest personal computer vendor by unit sales as of January 2021, following Lenovo and HP Inc..[10] Dell is the largest shipper of PC monitors worldwide.[11] Dell is the sixth-largest company in Texas by total revenue, according to Fortune magazine.[12] It is the second-largest non-oil company in Texas (behind AT&T) and the largest company in the Greater Austin area.[13] After going private in 2013, the newly confidential nature of its financial information prevents the company from being ranked by Fortune. It was a publicly traded company (NASDAQ: DELL), as well as a component of the NASDAQ-100 and S&P 500, until it was taken private in a leveraged buyout which closed on October 30, 2013.
        
        In 2015, Dell acquired the enterprise technology firm EMC Corporation; following the completion of the purchase, Dell and EMC became divisions of Dell Technologies. Dell EMC as a part of Dell Technologies focus on data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, cloud computing and other related products and services.</p>
<h3><b>ACER</b></h3>
<p id="acer" align="justify">Acer was founded in 1976 by Stan Shih (Chinese: 施振榮), his wife Carolyn Yeh, and five others as Multitech in Hsinchu City, Taiwan. The company began with eleven employees and US$25,000 in capital. Initially, it was primarily a distributor of electronic parts and a consultant in the use of microprocessor technologies. It produced the Micro-Professor MPF-I training kit, then two Apple II clones–the Microprofessor II and III–before joining the emerging IBM PC compatible market and becoming a significant PC manufacturer. The company was renamed to Acer in 1987.

    In 1998, Acer reorganized into five groups: Acer International Service Group, Acer Sertek Service Group, Acer Semiconductor Group, Acer Information Products Group, and Acer Peripherals Group. To dispel complaints from clients that Acer competed with its own products and to alleviate the competitive nature of the branded sales versus contract manufacturing businesses, the company spun off the contract business in 2000, renaming it ro Wistron Corporation. The restructuring resulted in two primary units: brand name sales and contract manufacturing. In 2001, the company sold its manufacturing units BenQ and Wistron in order to focus resources on design and sales.
    
    Acer increased worldwide sales while simultaneously reducing its labor force by identifying and using marketing strategies that best utilized their existing distribution channels. By 2005, Acer employed a scant 7,800 people worldwide. Revenues rose from US$4.9 billion in 2003[6] to US$11.31 billion in 2006.[7]
    
    Acer's North American market share has slipped over the past few years, while its European market share has risen.[8]
    
    In the mid-2000s, consumer notebooks were almost the sole growth drivers for the PC industry, and Acer's exceptionally low overheads and dedication to the channel made it one of the main beneficiaries of this trend.[9] Acer grew quickly in Europe in part by embracing the use of more traditional distribution channels targeting retail consumers when some rivals were pursuing online sales and business customers. In 2007, Acer bought Gateway in the United States and Packard Bell in Europe, and became the third largest provider of computers and the second largest for notebooks, achieving significant improvement in profitability. Acer has strived to become the world's largest PC vendor in the belief that the goal can help it achieve economy of scale and garner higher margin.[10] However, such a reliance on the high-volume, low-value PC market made Acer exposed when buying habits changed.
    
    In 2019, Acer announced esports social platform PLANET9.gg, which aims to provide gamers and esports enthusiasts game analytics, community-organized competitions, socializing experience and more.[</p>
<h4><b>LENOVO</b></h4>
